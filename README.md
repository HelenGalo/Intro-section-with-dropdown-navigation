Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- vanilla template
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to create a project using a template through vite which saves us time by already leaving the code and folders to be used at the same time, it allowed me to reinforce my knowledge of css and javascript attributes
